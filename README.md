A web project that uses the genetic algorithm to find increasingly better decisions trees, trained to play Tic Tac Toe.

This project was created using React.ts, Sass and Django. 

You can create a set of pools, deciding the number of players added. These players are created with a randomly generated decision
tree made which they use to decide what move they choose next. You can either run each action one at the time, using the play button
or have the games run continuously using the auto play running (the tab must be running) and pause at interesting points using the 
pause button.
